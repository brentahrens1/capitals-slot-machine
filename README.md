# Rock The Red 
**DESCRIPTION -**
"Rock The Red" is a Washington Capitals themed slot machine. The goal was to make it an experience any true Caps fan would love. Adding animations and audio that are randomized for each result in the game are designed to make you want to keep playing to see what happens next.

**GETTING STARTED -** 
I started with a notepad pseudo coding and sketching out ideas on how to go about the functionality of the game. I knew I would need an object array for the symbols and their properties as well as an array for the weighting of the reels to balance the odds of landing on certain combinations.

**BIGGEST CHALLENGE -** For me it was getting the images to move with the slot machine effect of appearing to be spinning on the reels. 

**FUTURE PLANS -** I would like to add more reels to the game to add more win combos to trigger different effects. I would also like to make it compatible on all screen sizes. 

**SUMMARY -** Most of what I set out to do creatively with this slot project was accomplished. I think the animations when you land on a 2 or 3 row combo is my favorite part. As well as all the audio features which make the game much more fun to play.
